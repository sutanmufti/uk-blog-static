        Every year, many Indonesians come to the UK to study and work. These Indonesians ask the same questions; where should I live? How much is the living cost? How do I access healthcare? and so on.

    <div class='caption'>
        Your question might also be asked by other Indonesians, and we might know stories relevant to your queries. On the other hand, if you have stories that you feel others might benefit, this is the platform to share such stories. We are a community making the best of living in the UK :&#41;
